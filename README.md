**Project background**

Founded in 2022, CustomHub52 is a California-based TikTok Shop specializing in personalized gifts and seasonal products. The store has experienced rapid growth, with seasonal gift items driving the majority of sales.

In its first year, CustomHub52 leveraged influencer marketing and TikTok ads as key revenue drivers, quickly expanding its customer base. With a data-driven approach, including advanced analytics and targeted campaign strategies, the store surpassed **20,000** customers, establishing itself as a leading brand in the personalized gifting space.

This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to group customers based on demographic attributes such as gender, age, and income to be able to cluster customers by segments. This clustering allows easier targeting and easier to predict of purchasing behaviour. After clustering, Logistic Regression is applied to predict the probability of customer purchases on a new dataset.
