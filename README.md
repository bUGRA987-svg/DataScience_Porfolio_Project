**Project background**

Founded in 2022, CustomHub52 is a California-based TikTok Shop specializing in personalized gifts and seasonal products. The store has experienced rapid growth, with seasonal gift items driving the majority of sales.

In its first year, CustomHub52 leveraged influencer marketing and TikTok ads as key revenue drivers, quickly expanding its customer base. With a data-driven approach, including advanced analytics and targeted campaign strategies, the store surpassed **20,000** customers, establishing itself as a leading brand in the personalized gifting space.

This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to group customers based on demographic attributes such as gender, age, and income to be able to cluster customers by segments. This clustering allows easier targeting and easier to predict of purchasing behaviour. After clustering, Logistic Regression is applied to predict the probability of customer purchases on a new dataset.


**Executive Summary**

**ðŸ”¹ Career-Focused Segment (43% of Customers)**

This segment consists mainly of individuals in high-level executive roles, contributing to 26% of revenue by segment and 36% of revenue from Product 4, indicating strong ambition and financial stability.

Marketing Strategy Recommendations:

*Increase bidding strategy by 20-40% to maximize ad reach, especially for high-ticket items.

*Adjust pricing by increasing product prices or reducing discount rates to maximize revenue potential.

*Horizontal scaling efforts on social media by duplicating successful ad sets that target the Standard Segment and Product 4.

*Offer early access or VIP discounts to incentivize high-value purchases.

**ðŸ”¹ Standard Segment (36% of Customers)**
This segment works in skilled employee, official, or management roles, representing 36% of the customer base and 48% of revenue from Product 5, making them a significant segment with high purchase power. They account for 43% of total sales, with Product 5 being the top-seller.

Marketing Strategy Recommendations:

*Horizontal scaling efforts on social media by duplicating ad sets that targets the Standard Segment and Product 5.

*Focus on influencer and affiliate marketing to generate new revenue streams for Product 5.

*Targeted premium email campaigns with product recommendations to insentive higher purchases.

*Increase retargeting efforts for customers who abandoned carts in the Standard Segment, offering them a time-sensitive discount.

**ðŸ”¹ Fewer Opportunities (12% of Customers)**
This segment is typically found in self-employed, highly qualified, or officer roles, representing the higher end of skilled occupations. They account for 12% of the customer base and hold the biggest proportion of revenue with 56% from Product 2, making them a smaller but influential group.

Marketing Strategy Recommendations:

*Target Product 2 specifically in new campaigns and ad sets to maximize reach and increase revenue.

*Leverage exclusive email marketing tailored to their ambition and success-driven mindset, promoting high-value items.

*Vertical and horizontal scaling: Run A/B tests to determine which method drives the best ROAS for this group.

*Explore premium products with personalized features such as custom name gifts or luxury options to appeal to their refined tastes.

*Launch E-mail Campaign for limited-edition products to create urgency for purchase.

**ðŸ”¹ Well-Off Segment (10% of Customers)**
This segment consists mostly of single women with average education levels and lower income within the range. Their occupations are generally on the lower end of the spectrum. They represent 9% of the dataset, contributing to 40% of revenue from Product 5, 26% from Product 4, and 24% from Product 2.

Marketing Strategy Recommendations:
*Target Product 5 in new campaigns and ad sets to improve reach and maximize revenue.

*Increase special offer and event E-mail Marketing to boost sales of Products 2, 4, and 5.

*Vertical and horizontal scaling: Run A/B tests on both strategies to determine the most effective method.

*Explore affordable product bundles to increase purchase probability for budget-conscious customers.

*Consider offering loyalty rewards for repeat purchases to build brand affinity and increase LTV.


**Project Deep-Dive**

I began this project with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by examining the data types, columns, and values to identify patterns and correlations. I used key methods such as .info(), .describe(), .corr(), and .head() to gain an initial understanding of the dataset. Next, I proceeded with data preprocessing. Since the dataset contained both categorical and ordinal values, I started by encoding categorical variables such as gender and marital status. I applied Label Encoding, assigning 1 and 0 to categories

My first challenge came across when encoding ordinal dataâ€”unlike categorical data, it needed to be enumerated based on its levels rather than arbitrary values. I initially attempted to use OrdinalEncoder, but I quickly realized it automatically assigns values in alphabetical order, which did not align with the logical ranking of my data. To solve this, I conducted further research using Google and AI tools and found a workaround. I created list variable for ordinal features, ensuring they were encoded correctly. Using .unique(), I extracted the distinct values for Education, Occupation, and Settlement Size, manually arranging them in ascending order before applying the encoding.

The next step was standardizing the data to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model. Since the dataset included variables with different scalesâ€”age (ranging from 18 to ~76) and income (ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands)â€”without standardization, the model would weigh income as the most significant factor. To address this, I applied MinMaxScaler, which scales values to a range between 0 and 1, preventing larger values from dominating the clustering process. I also tested StandardScaler, but after comparing both, I found that MinMaxScaler produced similar clustering results while being more interpretable for this dataset.

PCA and Modelling  
I have faced biggest challenge for this project as you will see at the diagrams cluster number isn't clear I cannot decide whether I should choose 2,4,5 or 7 because it can be all of them when you use elbow method. To address this challenge first I reduce the dimension from 7 to 4 this allows me to save on computing time and energy and also allows me to see clearly for choosing which of the cluster I should choose.

The visualizations above indicate that there is no clear optimal number of clusters. However, by reducing the dimensions, I was able to gain better insights into the clustering structure, making it easier to determine the appropriate number of clusters.

However, The cluster decision isn't clear yet. To address this, I used the Silhouette Score, which measures how well-defined clusters are. A lower Silhouette Score indicates more intertwined clusters, while a higher score suggests well-separated groups.

After analyzing the scores, I found that 4 clusters provided the best balance, ensuring distinct and meaningful segmentation for this project
